<h2>Drinks Menu</h2>

<p class="drinks-pastries-para">All of the coffees that we offer are made with real Tegridy Beans grown on a self sustainable farm in a small mountain town in Colorado where the water comes direct from Colorado Springs. We then take the Bean from farm to the caramelization point so it keeps a nice rich smokey but sweet flavour. To keep our Tegridy as high as it should be we even use any overroasted coffee beans for fuel in the roaster. This process means we can offer you the best product Tegridy Approved from Bean until the last drop touches your tastebuds.</p>

        <p class="descriptions">Here at Tegridy Beans we do coffee the way it should be and we were told we were crazy for even making a coffee with ice. But you asked so we did it. It's subtle and mild. Mild, like that first splash of sun on an April morning. All it took was Beans, milk, ice and sugar with a little bit of Tegrity in there to Zhuzh it up.</p>

       <h3>Latte</h3>
       <P class="prices">£2.25</P>
       <p class="descriptions">Smooth aroma with a mild taste, oh so special, like an Arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew. A light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon or a hug from your dear old aunt, and that aunt just offered you some Tegridy Beans Latte and with our supply of Flavoured Syrups you can keep that Tegridy going all year long.
